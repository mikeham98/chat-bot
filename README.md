## ChatBots
There are three chat bots available: TravelBot, PizzaBot, WebSearchBot. All of which return static data.
This could easily be swapped for a real backend which could provide dynamic responses.

### TravelBot
The TravelBot allows the user to book a holiday.
#### Responses:
Due to the bot returning static responses, I have included a suitable conversation between the bot and the user below.

## Notes to reviewer
- I am using json-server to act as a REST api for the application (the database is reset on running `npm run dev`)
- If messages do not appear it is most likely due to json-server not responding therefore please refresh the page
- I have used a mixture of both PureComponents and memos where I feel suitable, I tend to create memos for very simple
components which do not need internal logic. The reason for this is so that I don't create a function within a functional
component as this has performance implications due to the creation functions on render/update.
- There are no hooks in this project because where I would end up implementing them I would also need to add other logic within the
component. Therefore would essentially be creating functions on render/update like the above comment.
- I have avoided creating lambda functions within render methods where possible and have used bind(this) in the constructor to improve performance
- I haven't fully tested SideBar.jsx as it would take a very long time due to the nature of the component.
